  Here is where you will be able to find details on the two short analytical papers.
  
  <h5>Analytical Paper 1</h5>
  
  See <a href="intro-short-paper-1.pdf">here</a> for the assignment in PDF format.
  
  <p><em>Where in the world is the next international war likely to break out?</em></p>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to have you write a brief analytical paper that informs our broader understanding of the above question. To that end, you may approach this prompt in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Option 1</strong> is to directly answer the question by discussing two states that you believe are likely to engage in international war with each other in the near future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 2</strong> is to pick a case from recent/current events considered to be an international &quot;flashpoint&quot; (e.g., China-Taiwan, India-Pakistan, Iran-Iraq, Israel-Lebanon, etc.) and discuss whether or not concerns about war are warranted in that case. I am flexible on letting you choose a dispute that interests you. If you are not sure that the case in which you are interested is appropriate for the assignment, feel free to come talk to me about it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how you approach this question, you should draw on and/or engage the theoretical perspectives and explanations covered in our textbook, readings, and class discussions in justifying your answer. If you think war is or is not likely to break out in a given case, is that because of or in spite of the explanations we have reviewed in class? How do the factors that you identify as being important relate to the factors that political scientists believe make war more or less likely?</p>
<p>To be clear, I am <em>not</em> asking you to accurately predict the timing and location of the next international war. For the purposes of this assignment, there is no &quot;correct&quot; answer to this question (though it is conceivable that some of you may pick a dispute that turns out to be the next international war). Instead, your grade will be based on the extent to which you demonstrate an understanding of the key causes of war that we review in class and the clarity and organization of your argument. My hope is that this exercise will let you familiarize yourself with the details of a current international dispute that interests you and give you a chance to apply what we have discussed in class to real-world events.</p>
<p>Your paper should be between 4 and 5 double-spaced pages (12 point font, one-inch margins, stapled). You should use in-text citations in the author-year-page format (Frieden et al. 2016, 1). Please include a list of references at the end of your paper containing all sources cited in your paper. (The list of references is not included in the page count.) Your references should be in a consistent format. For an example, see the formatting of the readings in the syllabus.</p>
