  <b>Abstract:</b> 
The highest priority for national leaders is attaining and holding onto power. But some leaders know when their terms will end. Many US presidents have known when their time in office would end, even before the passage of the 22nd amendment. Do such limitations on their political ambitions have an impact on the foreign policies they formulate? Are they, for example, more or less likely to initiate or become involved in interstate conflict? Apparently not, except perhaps during recessions. Previous research on this issue and on the impact of various attributes of national leaders on foreign policies has tended to rely on directed dyadic level analyses, even though the hypotheses it evaluates pertain to single leaders or states. This is a potentially problematic research strategy.

Ex Ante Delegation in Humanitarian Aid

<b>Abstract:</b> 

Strategic and political interests tend to dictate states' allocations of bilateral emergency aid. In 2006, the United Nations created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to counteract this bias and help provide emergency humanitarian relief efficiently and impartially.  A key feature of the organization is the banning of earmarking. What are the implications of this institutional design choice for the supply of humanitarian relief and welfare in recipient countries?  I formalize a donor's decision to provide aid bilaterally <i>ex post</i>  versus (or in combination with) delegating <i>ex ante</i>  to a more efficient institution that may allocate aid in ways contrary to donor interests. I consider how allowing for limited earmarking affects the supply of international humanitarian aid. Using the models and a simulation, I show that a policy of allowing partial earmarking increases contributions and may improve average outcomes for crisis victims.

  <b>Abstract:</b> Recent research identifies the risk and consequences of losing office as important factors in leaders' decisions to initiate international conflicts. This paper argues that the institutional source of a domestic threat to a leader is an important variable that conditions the relationship between political insecurity and international conflict. Specifically, existing theoretical mechanisms linking international conflict to security in office should not apply to threats that come from outside a leader's selectorate. Natural disasters provide a convenient and quasi-experimental opportunity to test this argument since others have argued that disasters not only affect the risk that all types of leaders lose office, but that they do so by creating threats that operate through different mechanisms in different domestic institutional contexts. I find that deaths from disasters are positively associated with conflict initiation among large-coalition leaders throughout the period of 1950 to 2007.  I also find that neither disaster deaths nor events are related to conflict behavior for small-coalition leaders. In arguing that not all threats to leader survival matter for international conflict, the paper offers an important qualification to theories of leader survival and international conflict.

<h4>
International Politics and Internal Aid Allocation
</h4>

<b>Abstract:</b> 

Temporary members of the United Nations Security Council tend to receive more World Bank aid projects. This paper asks whether temporary Security Council membership also affects geographic patterns of aid allocation within recipient countries. If temporary Security Council membership leads the Bank to approve project requests that it would otherwise turn down, a recipient government might gain greater discretion over the internal distribution of aid projects when it holds a seat on the Security Council. Others have argued that leaders may exhibit favoritism toward their birth regions in allocating aid internally. A reasonable expectation is that birth regions will be more likely to receive or will receive a greater proportion of World Bank projects when the country of which they are a part is a temporary Security Council member. At the same time, some find that World Bank projects tend not to exhibit a bias toward leaders' birth regions. Whether this relationship varies with the international strategic position of the recipient country remains unexplored. Using data on geo-referenced aid projects in all countries that received World Bank projects throughout the period of 1995 to 2014, I find that while Security Council membership is associated with receiving more projects, temporary Security Council membership does not affect the proportion of World Bank projects flowing to leaders' birth regions. On average, birth region status appears to be unrelated to the likelihood that a subnational region receives a World Bank project. This is consistent with recent evidence that World Bank projects are less susceptible to political targeting relative to projects from other donors (e.g., China).

Domestic Uncertainty, Third-Party Resolve, and International Conflict <small> with <a href="http://bryanandrewrooney.wordpress.com/">Bryan Rooney</small> </a>

<b>Abstract:</b> Uncertainty about resolve is a well-established rationalist explanation for war. In addition to estimating the resolve of their immediate rivals, states decide to initiate conflicts (or take actions that risk escalating to war) based on expectations about how third parties will respond. We argue that rival states should become more likely to develop inconsistent estimates of their relative capabilities and resolve -- and thus should become more likely to fight -- when domestic political changes occur in third party states that have security pacts with either dyad member.  We test and find support for this hypothesis using a data set of changes in leaders' domestic supporting coalitions and data on militarized interstate disputes from 1945 to 2000.

  Contracting Arms Sales and Alliance Agreements with Moral Hazard and Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/brett-benson">Brett Benson</a></small>

  <b>Abstract:</b> This paper develops two three-player models for studying arms and alliance contracts. Prospective partners design contracts in the shadow of conflict and in anticipation of moral hazard as well as the costs of transacting arms. The selection of arms versus alliances depends on partners’ security and policy preferences as well as the costs of moral hazard and arms. The argument also demonstrates conditions under which the level of arms in a transaction might vary. Additionally, gaps in capabilities between third-party defenders and their proteges may increase the likelihood that third-party defenders will opt for arms sales, and the larger allies’ capabilities diverge, the smaller the amount of arms will be transferred. Implications are analyzed using data from US arms sales to Taiwan.
