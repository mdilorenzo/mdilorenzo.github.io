 <b>Abstract:</b> Scholars and policymakers have argued that bypassing recipient governments by channeling aid through intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations can help donors pursue development goals without bolstering autocratic regimes. This paper argues that bypass aid can help autocrats retain power by reducing the amount of concessions needed to deter revolution. I show that autocracies experience less domestic unrest as the proportion of aid delivered through bypass channels increases. To address potential endogeneity, I conduct an instrumental variables analysis. I argue that scandals where governments are suspected of or caught misusing aid should exogenously affect the distribution of aid across channels by causing donors to deliver more aid through bypass channels overall. I use the aid scandals data to instrument for bypass aid in two-stage models to confirm the baseline results.

The Design of International Institutions for Humanitarian Aid

<b>Abstract:</b> 

Strategic and political interests tend to dictate states' allocations of bilateral emergency aid. In 2006, the United Nations created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to counteract this bias and help provide emergency humanitarian relief efficiently and impartially.  A key feature of the organization is the banning of earmarking. What are the implications of this institutional design choice for the supply of humanitarian relief and welfare in recipient countries?  I formalize a donor's decision to provide aid bilaterally <i>ex post</i>  versus (or in combination with) delegating <i>ex ante</i>  to a more efficient institution that may allocate aid in ways contrary to donor interests. I consider how allowing for limited earmarking affects the supply of international humanitarian aid. Using the models and a simulation, I show that a policy of allowing partial earmarking increases contributions and may improve average outcomes for crisis victims.

  Natural Disasters, Leader Survival, and International Conflict

  <b>Abstract:</b> Existing work finds that natural disasters affect leader survival, and that the risk and consequences of losing office influence leaders' international conflict behavior. This paper considers how disasters may indirectly affect the risk of international conflict by affecting leader survival. I argue that disasters should only matter for the conflict behavior of large-coalition leaders. As disaster deaths increase, large-coalition leaders fearing irregular removal from office should be more prone to conflict, while those anticipating regular removal should engage in conflict less frequently. I find evidence that deaths from disasters are associated with modest increases in conflict initiation among large-coalition leaders facing irregular removal throughout the period of 1950 to 2007.  Against the expectations of the theory, however, large-coalition leaders facing <i>regular</i> removal also appear to become more likely to initiate conflicts in the wake of disasters. There is only limited evidence that the distinction between regular and irregular removal matters for large-coalition leaders. Consistent with the theory, deaths from disasters are unrelated to conflict behavior for small-coalition leaders. However, small-coalition leaders facing irregular removal appear to be less likely to initiate conflicts as more disaster events occur, which is the opposite of what existing theory would expect. In arguing that different types of threats to leader survival survival matter differently for international conflict, the paper offers an important qualification to theories of leader survival and international conflict.

Uncertainty, Third-Party Resolve, and International Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/bryan-rooney">Bryan Rooney</small> </a>

<b>Abstract:</b> Uncertainty about resolve is a well-established rationalist explanation for war. In addition to estimating the resolve of their immediate rivals, states decide to initiate conflicts (or take actions that risk escalating to war) based on expectations about how third parties will respond. We argue that rival states should become more likely to develop inconsistent estimates of their relative capabilities and resolve -- and thus should become more likely to fight -- when domestic political changes occur in third party states that have security pacts with either dyad member.  We test and find support for this hypothesis using a data set of changes in leaders' domestic supporting coalitions and data on militarized interstate disputes from 1945 to 2000.

  <b>Abstract:</b> 
The highest priority for national leaders is attaining and holding onto power. But some leaders know when their terms will end. Many US presidents have known when their time in office would end, even before the passage of the 22nd amendment. Do such limitations on their political ambitions have an impact on the foreign policies they formulate? Are they, for example, more or less likely to initiate or become involved in interstate conflict? Apparently not, except perhaps during recessions. Previous research on this issue and on the impact of various attributes of national leaders on foreign policies has tended to rely on directed dyadic level analyses, even though the hypotheses it evaluates pertain to single leaders or states. This is a potentially problematic research strategy.

  Contracting Arms Sales and Alliance Agreements with Moral Hazard and Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/brett-benson">Brett Benson</a></small>

  <b>Abstract:</b> This paper develops two three-player models for studying arms and alliance contracts. Prospective partners design contracts in the shadow of conflict and in anticipation of moral hazard as well as the costs of transacting arms. The selection of arms versus alliances depends on partners’ security and policy preferences as well as the costs of moral hazard and arms. The argument also demonstrates conditions under which the level of arms in a transaction might vary. Additionally, gaps in capabilities between third-party defenders and their proteges may increase the likelihood that third-party defenders will opt for arms sales, and the larger allies’ capabilities diverge, the smaller the amount of arms will be transferred. Implications are analyzed using data from US arms sales to Taiwan.
