  <b>Abstract:</b> 
The highest priority for national leaders is attaining and holding onto power. But some leaders know when their terms will end. Many US presidents have known when their time in office would end, even before the passage of the 22nd amendment. Do such limitations on their political ambitions have an impact on the foreign policies they formulate? Are they, for example, more or less likely to initiate or become involved in interstate conflict? Apparently not, except perhaps during recessions. Previous research on this issue and on the impact of various attributes of national leaders on foreign policies has tended to rely on directed dyadic level analyses, even though the hypotheses it evaluates pertain to single leaders or states. This is a potentially problematic research strategy.

  <b>Abstract:</b> Some point to recent high-profile Chinese aid and investment agreements that have followed changes in recipient leadership (e.g., Afghanistan, Philippines) as evidence that China seeks to compete for political influence in countries that are traditionally close to the United States and its allies. We examine how patterns of Chinese development investments vary with domestic changes in potential recipient countries. We argue that leadership turnover plausibly creates uncertainty about whether recipient countries will shift political allegiance toward or away from Chinese influence. If China views development finance as a tool to acquire or maintain influence in developing countries, the timing of leadership transitions in developing countries should coincide with increases in development commitments from China. We use AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset set and an extended version of the Change in Source of Leader Support data set of domestic coalition changes to evaluate the relationship between Chinese finance and leader turnover in non-OECD countries throughout the period of 2000--2014. Our analysis provides some statistical evidence that political turnover influences the allocation of more concessional, ODA-like finance from China. We find further that the effects of domestic changes on Chinese financial flows depend on whether the recipient country has an alliance with the United States and the regime type of the recipient.

<b>Abstract:</b> 

Strategic and political interests tend to dictate states' allocations of bilateral emergency aid. In 2006, the United Nations created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to counteract this bias and help provide emergency humanitarian relief efficiently and impartially.  A key feature of the organization is the banning of earmarking. What are the implications of this institutional design choice for the supply of humanitarian relief and welfare in recipient countries?  I formalize a donor's decision to provide aid bilaterally <i>ex post</i>  versus (or in combination with) delegating <i>ex ante</i>  to a more efficient institution that may allocate aid in ways contrary to donor interests. I consider how allowing for limited earmarking affects the supply of international humanitarian aid. Using the models and a simulation, I show that a policy of allowing partial earmarking increases contributions and may improve average outcomes for crisis victims.

  Foreign Direct Investment and Domestic Political Change <small> with <a href="http://bryanandrewrooney.wordpress.com/">Bryan Rooney</small> </a>

  <b>Abstract:</b> A central hypothesis in the foreign direct investment (FDI) literature is that multinational firms condition their investment choices on domestic political dynamics and instability in host countries.  Existing research on this question focuses mainly on relatively static measures of domestic political context such as the presence or absence of certain political or legal institutions that may enhance the security of firms' investments. Yet no existing study systematically examines the relationship between domestic political events and investment behavior. Recent literature identifies turnover in domestic governing coalitions as an important source of political uncertainty. We argue that domestic turnover in potential host countries should be associated with decreased FDI. Because domestic changes create uncertainty about the future direction of policy in a variety of areas relevant to investment decisions -- e.g., changes in privileged relationships between the state and certain domestic producers or industries, trade barriers, tax policies -- firms should exercise greater caution following domestic turnover in potential host countries. However, various institutional features of democracies -- transparency, policy consistency across ruling coalitions, and peaceful transitions of power -- should mitigate the extent to which domestic turnover causes uncertainty and deters investment. For this reason, we expect domestic turnover in democratic host countries to be unrelated to FDI flows. Using data on changes in governing coalitions from the Change in Source of Leader Support dataset (Mattes, Leeds and Matsumura 2016), we find support for these expectations. While non-democracies see less investment in the wake of a change in the source of leader support, FDI flows to democracies do not change significantly following domestic turnover. Our analysis enhances our understanding of the determinants of FDI and provides further evidence that the distinction between democratic and non-democratic institutions matters for foreign and domestic policy in a new empirical domain.

<h4>
International Politics and Internal Aid Allocation

<b>Abstract:</b> 

Temporary members of the United Nations Security Council tend to receive more World Bank aid projects. This paper asks whether temporary Security Council membership also affects geographic patterns of aid allocation within recipient countries. If temporary Security Council membership leads the Bank to approve project requests that it would otherwise turn down, a recipient government might gain greater discretion over the internal distribution of aid projects when it holds a seat on the Security Council. Others have argued that leaders may exhibit favoritism toward their birth regions in allocating aid internally. A reasonable expectation is that birth regions will be more likely to receive or will receive a greater proportion of World Bank projects when the country of which they are a part is a temporary Security Council member. At the same time, some find that World Bank projects tend not to exhibit a bias toward leaders' birth regions. Whether this relationship varies with the international strategic position of the recipient country remains unexplored. Using data on geo-referenced aid projects in all countries that received World Bank projects throughout the period of 1995 to 2014, I find that while Security Council membership is associated with receiving more projects, temporary Security Council membership does not affect the proportion of World Bank projects flowing to leaders' birth regions. On average, birth region status appears to be unrelated to the likelihood that a subnational region receives a World Bank project. This is consistent with recent evidence that World Bank projects are less susceptible to political targeting relative to projects from other donors (e.g., China).

  Contracting Arms Sales and Alliance Agreements with Moral Hazard and Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/brett-benson">Brett Benson</a></small>

  <b>Abstract:</b> This paper develops two three-player models for studying arms and alliance contracts. Prospective partners design contracts in the shadow of conflict and in anticipation of moral hazard as well as the costs of transacting arms. The selection of arms versus alliances depends on partners’ security and policy preferences as well as the costs of moral hazard and arms. The argument also demonstrates conditions under which the level of arms in a transaction might vary. Additionally, gaps in capabilities between third-party defenders and their proteges may increase the likelihood that third-party defenders will opt for arms sales, and the larger allies’ capabilities diverge, the smaller the amount of arms will be transferred. Implications are analyzed using data from US arms sales to Taiwan.
