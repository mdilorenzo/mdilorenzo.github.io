 <b>Abstract:</b> Theories of foreign aid and political survival often treat aid as a government-to-government transfer of cash. However, donors increasingly bypass recipient governments by channeling aid through intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. Scholars and policymakers have pointed to this as a way that donors can pursue development goals without bolstering autocratic regimes. I build on a model of revolution to argue that bypass aid can help autocrats retain power by reducing the amount of concessions needed to deter revolution. Empirical tests using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that autocratic countries experience less domestic unrest as the proportion of aid delivered through bypass channels increases. To address concerns about endogeneity, I conduct an instrumental variables analysis. I argue that aid scandals -- instances where recipient governments are suspected of or caught misusing aid -- should act as an exogenous shock to the distribution of aid in a given country by causing donors to deliver more aid through bypass channels overall. I confirm the baseline results using a new measure of extra-continental aid scandals (i.e., scandals that occur outside a given country's continent) as an instrument for bypass aid in a two-stage model. To deal with potential measurement problems in the OECD data, I replicate key parts of the analysis using an original alternative measure of bypass aid.

The Design of International Institutions for Humanitarian Aid

<b>Abstract:</b> Donors' political and strategic interests tend to drive both development and emergency aid. In 2006 the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs formed the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to overcome political biases in emergency aid allocation and respond to humanitarian crises rapidly and efficiently.  A key institutional feature of this organization is that donors are not allowed to earmark contributions for specific projects, purposes, or locations. What are the implications of this institutional design choice for the supply of humanitarian relief and the welfare of vulnerable populations in recipient countries? Assessments of CERF allocations (including a new test in this paper) suggest that the organization succeeds in providing need-based relief, though the amount of relief provided by the organization represents a substantively marginal proportion of humanitarian aid. I formalize a donor's decision to provide aid bilaterally <i>ex post</i> versus (or in combination with) delegating <i>ex ante</i>  to a more efficient institution that may allocate aid in ways contrary to donor interests. I consider how allowing for limited earmarking affects contribution levels and expected outcomes in countries experiencing humanitarian crises. Using the models and a simulation, I show that allowing partial earmarking leads to larger donor contributions and often leads to better outcomes on average for victims of humanitarian crises.

  Leader Survival, Natural Disasters, and International Conflict

  <b>Abstract:</b> Existing work shows that natural disasters affect leader survival, and that the risk and consequences of losing office influence leaders' international conflict behavior. In this paper, I specify how disasters may interact with domestic institutions and the consequences of losing office to affect leaders' international conflict behavior. While disasters affect the survival of all types of leaders, I argue that disasters' effects on leader survival should only matter for the conflict behavior of large-coalition leaders. As disaster deaths increase, large-coalition leaders fearing irregular removal from office should be more prone to conflict, while those anticipating regular removal should engage in conflict less frequently. Empirical tests confirm that deaths from disasters are associated with an increased frequency of conflict initiation among large-coalition leaders facing irregular removal, and that disasters do not affect the conflict behavior of small-coalition leaders regardless of how they expect to be removed from office.  Among large-coalition leaders facing <i>regular</i> removal, those who lead economically and militarily weaker countries are less likely to initiate international conflicts as disaster deaths increase. In introducing the source of a threat to a leader as an explanatory variable, the paper suggests an important qualification to theories of leader survival and international conflict.

Uncertainty, Third-Party Resolve, and International Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/bryan-rooney">Bryan Rooney</small> <!--</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="utpric.pdf">PDF--></a>

<b>Abstract:</b> Uncertainty about resolve is a well-established rationalist explanation for war. In addition to estimating the resolve of their immediate rivals, states decide to initiate conflicts (or take actions that risk escalating to war) based on expectations about how third parties will respond. We argue that rival states should become more likely to develop inconsistent estimates of their relative capabilities and resolve -- and thus should become more likely to fight -- when domestic political changes occur in third party states that have security pacts with either dyad member.  We test and find support for this hypothesis using a data set of changes in leaders' domestic supporting coalitions and data on militarized interstate disputes from 1945 to 2000.

  <b>Abstract:</b> 
The highest priority for national leaders is attaining and holding onto power. But some leaders know when their terms will end. Many US presidents have known when their time in office would end, even before the passage of the 22nd amendment. Do such limitations on their political ambitions have an impact on the foreign policies they formulate? Are they, for example, more or less likely to initiate or become involved in interstate conflict? Apparently not, except perhaps during recessions. Previous research on this issue and on the impact of various attributes of national leaders on foreign policies has tended to rely on directed dyadic level analyses, even though the hypotheses it evaluates pertain to single leaders or states. This is a potentially problematic research strategy.

  Contracting Arms Sales and Alliance Agreements with Moral Hazard and Conflict <small> with <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/brett-benson">Brett Benson</a></small>

  <b>Abstract:</b> This paper develops two three-player models for studying arms and alliance contracts. Prospective partners design contracts in the shadow of conflict and in anticipation of moral hazard as well as the costs of transacting arms. The selection of arms versus alliances depends on partners’ security and policy preferences as well as the costs of moral hazard and arms. The argument also demonstrates conditions under which the level of arms in a transaction might vary. Additionally, gaps in capabilities between third-party defenders and their proteges may increase the likelihood that third-party defenders will opt for arms sales, and the larger allies’ capabilities diverge, the smaller the amount of arms will be transferred. Implications are analyzed using data from US arms sales to Taiwan.
